      <h1>Once upen a time...</h1>
      <h2>
        ...there was a coffee lover that decides to <span>explore</span> the
        world. She flavored food with feelings, colored paper with the light
        reflected in her lenses. She shared her experiences with others, but her
        curiosity was not satisfied. <br /><br />
        She wanted to know how other people would <span>experience</span> the
        same situation. She wanted to <span>feel</span> through other’s
        feelings, <span>see</span> through other’s eyes. And then she begun a
        new adventure, full of challenges and rewards. <br /><br />
        To me, UX design is to tell a <span>story</span> in a way that
        <span>everyone</span> will be able to <span>understand</span>.
